\title{Plot Dynamic Influence of Parents on a Target Node}
\usage{
plot_marginal(
  mdm_object,
  target_node,
  distribution = "filt",
  scale_series = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdm_object}{An object of class \code{"mdm"} as returned by \code{\link{mdm}}.}

\item{target_node}{Integer index specifying the target node (child).}

\item{distribution}{Whether to use "filt" (filtered) or "smoo" (smoothed) posterior estimates.
Default is \code{"filt"}.}

\item{scale_series}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, all time series (observed and parental contributions)
are standardized (mean zero, unit variance). Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the dynamic contributions and the observed series.
}
\description{
Visualizes the dynamic influence of each parent node on the target node
over time by computing the time-varying contribution of each parent series
weighted by its dynamic coefficient.
}
\details{
The contribution of a parent to the target node at time \eqn{t} is calculated as:
\deqn{
\text{Contribution}_{i \rightarrow j}(t) = \beta_{i \rightarrow j}(t) \cdot Y_i(t)
}
where \eqn{\beta_{i \rightarrow j}(t)} is the time-varying coefficient estimated from the dynamic model,
and \eqn{Y_i(t)} is the observed time series of parent node \eqn{i}.

These contributions are plotted as colored lines alongside the observed series for the target node (in black),
enabling interpretation of how the influence from each parent evolves over time.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Estimate model
result <- mdm(data_input = y)

# Plot parental influence (no scaling)
plot_marginal(result, Y = as.matrix(y), target_node = 2, scale_series = FALSE)

# Standardize series before plotting
plot_marginal(result, Y = as.matrix(y), target_node = 2, scale_series = TRUE)
}
